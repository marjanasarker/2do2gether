Many of us have wondered whether we would ever be able to solidify that one good habit, be it running, meditation etc. 

Few are able to accomplish it because we try to set up too many good habits together.

Even worse, we think perhaps if we announce it on social media, maybe that would hold us accountable. 

Unfortunately, what ends up happening is that none of those habits were solidified and the pressure from having declared 
in social media seems to crush any kind of motivation. Speaking from personal experience, limiting to 1 - 3 habits to solidify
within a 30 day period and pairing up with a partner who shares the same habit and goal as you does wonders.

**Ever wanted an app that can streamline that process for you?**

# Introducing:

# 2do 2gether - a 30 day habit setter with accounatability partners
* The user can choose a maximum of 3 habits they want to accomplish in a month.
* The user gets 2 choices on how they want to form this habit: hours or days.
* For example, if a user chose hours, they will set a goal to accrue said hours of the activity within one month. 
* The user can choose 1 accountability partner who sends a cutomized message encouraging user to complete task and also check on what the user's progress is.
* The user's accountability partner for that habit is also working on the same habit. 
* The user writes a bullet journal entry comparable whether they complete the task or not.
* The user will have access to a daily activity tracker.
* At the end of 30 days, the user will receive a comprehensive report on their completions/incompletions along with the bullet journal entries and accountability partner messages.
