# 2do 2gether - a 30 day habit setter with accounatability partners
* The user can choose a maximum of 3 habits they want to accomplish in a month.
* The user gets 2 choices on how they want to form this habit: hours or days.
* For example, if a user chose hours, they will set a goal to accrue said hours of the activity within one month. 
* The user can choose 1 accountability partner who sends a cutomized message encouraging user to complete task and also check on what the user's progress is.
* The user's accountability partner for that habit is also working on the same habit. 
* The user writes a bullet journal entry comparable whether they complete the task or not.
* The user will have access to a daily activity tracker.
* At the end of 30 days, the user will receive a comprehensive report on their completions/incompletions along with the bullet journal entries and accountability partner messages.
